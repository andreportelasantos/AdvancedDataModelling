Purchased this phone about 2 months ago and i have never been so dissapointed , not durable having smashed at a knee height drop, the touchscreen gradually ceased to work ontop of it constantly crashing and freezing even before the drop, my galaxy s6 was such faster and durable. Do not waste your money people.
