I purchased this phone a month and a half ago and it is no longer working. apps are slow and freeze the phone constantly. through no fault of my own the phone decided it will no longer charge. it has a faulty charger input. I would expect this towards the end of my contract not at the beginning! customer service was unhelpful and the problem is still not resolved. would 100% not recommend, i will not be buying samsung products again.
