    "- How can I search for tokens in text more flexibly? For example, to find all all mentions of `woman` and `women`, or all words starting with `multi`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for tokens in text using regular expressions you need the `re` module and its search function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to construct regular expressions. E.g. you can use a wildcard * or you can use a range of letters, e.g. [ae] (for a or e), [a-z] (for a to z), or numbers, e.g. [0-9] (for all single digits) etc. Regular expressions can be very powerful if used correctly. To find all mentions of the words woman or women you need to use the following regular expression wom[ae]n."

    "\n",
    "**Regular expressions** are ways to be 'a bit vague' about text. (While being increadibly specific at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example Let's imagine we want to see all tokens that refer to `women` in text. If we were working with a person (not a computer) they might already assume I mean both singlular `woman` and plural `women`. But computers need us to be very very specific, and so we are provided with a way to describe small acceptable difference. This syntax is called regular expressions (RegEx).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we arrive at regular expressions is a process of specifying what we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could say: give me all occurances of `woman` and `women` and then add them all.\n",
    "- I could say: give me all occurances of `wom*n` where `*` is `a` or `e` \n",
    "- I could use regex to say give me all occurances of `wom[ae]n`\n",
    "- I could use regex to say give me all occurances of `^wom[ae]n$` which also means that there can be nothing before or after these characters, so `superwomen` and `womenhood` will not be included "
